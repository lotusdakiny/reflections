How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    $diff -u file_old file_new

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see chenges I made and I can easily back to my old version, if I do not like changes 
    and I can compare two versions to find bugs and differencies 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    cons: I can forget to save
    pros: Only I can know logical sence to make a commit	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because most of projects consist of more than 1 file and some chenges can affect more then 1 file
    than it is very useful to see all stane of all files in the project in one commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    $ git log //history
    $ git diff file_old file_new

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easily find in which version I did mistake

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try ro work with Sunshine app and with my own project and with Jorge
